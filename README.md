# Math Garden

It's a webpage which is designed for kids to practice basic math (single digit additions) where they can write digits in the canvas available on the webpage and if the answer is correct, the garden grows and for every wrong answer garden decreases a step size. It was built using Image classification Machine learning algorithm (Recognising Handwritten Digits).
